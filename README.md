> ## ⚠️ Important Notice
> This project is currently not in a working state and is under active development. Updates and fixes are being implemented to bring the app to a functional state. Please check back for updates or contribute to its progress.

In ancient Greek mythology, Prometheus was a Titan revered for his cunning and foresight. Defying the Olympian gods, he bestowed upon humanity a gift of immeasurable value – fire. This was not just literal fire, but a symbol of technology, knowledge, and the spark of civilization itself. Prometheus, whose name means 'forethought', was celebrated as a champion of mankind, empowering them with the tools for progress and enlightenment, much to the chagrin of Zeus and the other gods who wished to keep humans in a state of dependency and ignorance.

## Enlightenment Through Education

Mirroring this legendary benefactor, the Prometheus app emerges as a beacon of hope and empowerment within the confinements of prison walls. It offers inmates a transformative tool – a comprehensive platform providing access to educational resources, degree plans, course schedules, and more. By equipping inmates with technology and knowledge, Prometheus paves a path for their reentry into society. Like the mythical fire, it ignites a new beginning, fostering personal growth, intellectual development, and the promise of a brighter, reformed future. This digital mentor opens doors to a world beyond bars, offering a chance for redemption and the rebuilding of lives through the power of education.

## Planned Features

### Comprehensive Educational Resources
- **Access to Learning Material**: Provides inmates with a wide range of educational content, including textbooks, articles, and interactive learning modules.
- **Curated Educational Links**: Links to approved online resources, ensuring safe and relevant educational material is accessible.

### Personalized Learning Experience
- **Custom Degree Plans**: Inmates can explore and customize their degree paths based on personal interests and goals. A middle layer will be created for CTC Link, enabling students to apply for classes while adhering to DOC Policy 500, which prioritizes students closer to reentry. This eliminates the need for staff to build classes manually and allows students to take control of their academic journey.
- **Course Scheduling**: This system will automate class roster creation in CTC Link following DOC Policy 500, ensuring compliance while reducing manual administrative work.

### Academic Management
- **Transcript Services**: Easy access to academic transcripts, allowing inmates to track and share their educational progress.
- **Study Time Planner**: Tools to help inmates plan and optimize their study time effectively.

### Computer Lab Scheduling
- **Digital Lab Time Scheduling**: Enables students to schedule computer lab time through the website. The system will automatically prevent scheduling during times when students are enrolled in classes, ensuring no conflicts and maximizing resource utilization.

### Instructor Interaction
- **Office Hours Scheduling**: A digital feature for students to schedule or sign up for office hours with instructors through the website, making it easier to facilitate one-on-one interactions.

### Staff-Specific Features
- **Asset Management**: Enables education staff to manage assets such as books, laptops, calculators, and other materials provided to students. This system will use barcodes and signature pads for automated equipment charging and educational agreement signing. Each prison site's inventory will sync with a central database for use by the State Board of Community and Technical Colleges (SBCTC) and eventually integrate with DOC systems to help staff identify items students should or should not have.

### Reentry Support
- **Reentry Planning Resources**: Information and guidance on using educational achievements for reintegration into society.
- **Career Pathways**: Resources that connect educational achievements with potential career opportunities post-release.

### Community Engagement
- **News/Blogging Section**: Allows approved students in groups like the Student Voices Council to submit news articles for review and approval, providing a platform for sharing student perspectives and updates.

### User-Centric Design
- **Intuitive Interface**: Designed for ease of use, considering the unique environment and technological access in prison settings.
- **Accessibility Features**: Ensures accessibility for all users, including those with disabilities.

### Security and Privacy
- **Secure Access**: Ensures user data privacy and app security, complying with institutional regulations.
- **Content Filtering**: Rigorous filtering of accessible content to align with prison safety and security standards.
- **Active Directory Integration**: Incorporates single sign-on for seamless and secure access, leveraging existing user credentials.

### Future Integrations
- **Integration with DOC Systems**: Plans to synchronize the platform with Department of Corrections systems to enhance data sharing and operational efficiency.

Prometheus aims to revolutionize education in correctional facilities, fostering a culture of learning and growth while adhering to institutional policies and ensuring user security.
